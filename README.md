# CLTV
Implementing CLTV using RFM and Flask
1. Introduction
In this project, we are building a ML model which will be predicting Customer Lifetime Value using RFM segmentation. 
1.1What is Customer Lifetime Value
Customer lifetime value (CLV) is one of the key stats likely to be tracked as part of a customer experience program. CLV is a measurement of how valuable a customer is to your company with an unlimited time span as opposed to just the first purchase. This metric helps you understand a reasonable cost per acquisition.CLV is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of their relationship. It’s an important metric as it costs less to keep existing customers than it does to acquire new ones, so increasing the value of your existing customers is a great way to drive growth.
If the CLV of an average coffee shop customer is $1,000 and it costs more than $1,000 to acquire a new customer (advertising, marketing, offers, etc.) the coffee chain could be losing money unless it pares back its acquisition costs.Knowing the CLV helps businesses develop strategies to acquire new customers and retain existing ones while maintaining profit margins.
1.2 How to measure CLV
If you’ve bought a $40 Christmas tree from the same grower for the last 10 years, your CLV has been worth $400 to them. But as you can imagine, in bigger companies CLV gets more complicated to calculate.Some companies don’t attempt to measure CLV, citing the challenges of segregated teams, inadequate systems, and untargeted marketing.
When data from all areas of an organisation is integrated however, it becomes easier to calculate CLV.
CLV can be measured in the following way:
1.	Identify the touch-points where the customer creates the value
2.	Integrate records to create the customer journey
3.	Measure revenue at each touch-point
4.	Add together over the lifetime of that customer
At its simplest, the formula for measuring CLV is:
Customer revenue minus the costs of acquiring and serving the customer = CLV
Functions can be added to this simple formula to reflect multiple purchases, behaviour patterns, and engagement to predict CLV.
